# Stryke
WIP: A C++ library build on top of Orc C library.

## Compilation

We use [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) to manage dependencies

Stryke depend on:
* [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)
* [Apache-Orc](https://orc.apache.org/)

```
./vcpkg install catch2 orc
```

### Compile

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
# configure make with vcpkg toolchain
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=${VCPKG_DIR}/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
make
```
